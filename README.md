# Health Freak 🥗

**Your AI-Powered Food Ingredient Scanner**

Health Freak helps you make informed food choices by instantly analyzing ingredient lists using artificial intelligence. Simply snap a photo of any food label and get an instant breakdown of which ingredients are clean and which ones to avoid.

## 📱 What is Health Freak?

Health Freak is a mobile app that takes the guesswork out of reading food labels. Whether you're trying to eat cleaner, avoid certain additives, or just want to know what you're putting in your body, Health Freak gives you instant, AI-powered insights into every ingredient.

## ✨ How It Works

1. **📸 Snap a Photo** – Point your camera at any ingredient list on food packaging.
2. **🤖 AI Analysis** – Our advanced AI instantly reads and analyzes each ingredient.
3. **✅ Get Results** – See which ingredients are clean (green) and which are potentially harmful (red).
4. **📊 Review History** – Track all your scans and revisit past analyses anytime.

## 📖 What Makes an Ingredient "Clean" or "Toxic"?

Health Freak displays simplified labels in the app interface: **Clean** (for "Generally Clean" ingredients) and **Toxic** (for "Potentially Toxic" ingredients). These represent educational opinions evaluated through a holistic, wellness-focused lens.

### Our Philosophy

Health Freak analyzes ingredients through a "crunchy lifestyle" lens – prioritizing whole, organic, unprocessed foods while being cautious about synthetic additives, artificial ingredients, and heavily processed substances. Our AI is specifically prompted to evaluate ingredients from this wellness-focused perspective, which may be more conservative than mainstream regulatory standards.

Health Freak's AI considers:

- **Scientific research** on health effects and potential concerns
- **Natural vs. synthetic origins**, favoring minimally processed ingredients
- **Common allergens** and sensitivities
- **Processing methods** and artificial additives
- **Holistic health perspectives**, flagging ingredients that may be "generally recognized as safe" but raise wellness concerns

### Important Note

These classifications are educational opinions—not medical advice or regulatory determinations. An ingredient marked "Potentially Toxic" may still be approved by regulatory agencies. We simply approach food through a more cautious, natural-focused lens. Always consult healthcare professionals for personalized dietary guidance.
